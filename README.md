## Getting Started

The theme is installed manually or via the /install.php feature of Multifaucet.

### Prerequisites

```
sudo apt-get install git -y
```

### Installing

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/ThatKalle/multifaucet-fak.git 
cp -r multifaucet-fak/faktheme /your/website/folder/themes/faktheme
cd
rm -r multifaucet-fak/ -f
```

Run the http://example.com/install.php process once again and select faktheme.

## Versioning

Updating the theme is done by running through the install procedure once more.

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/ThatKalle/multifaucet-fak.git
rm -r /your/website/folder/themes/faktheme -f
cp -r multifaucet-fak/faktheme /your/website/folder/themes/faktheme
cd
rm -r multifaucet-fak/ -f
```

You'll have to update the file permissions once again to fit your needs and/or update any and all custom settings.
